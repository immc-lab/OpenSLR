OpenSLR.Pipeline
=================

Introduction
------------
The Pipeline component defines the end-to-end execution workflow for training, testing, inference, and feature extraction in OpenSLR.

Supported Pipelines
-------------------
- **Training**: Full model training with validation.
- **Testing**: Evaluation on test sets.
- **Inference**: Prediction on new videos.
- **Extraction**: Feature extraction for downstream tasks.

Usage
-----
.. code-block:: python

    from OpenSLR.Pipeline import TrainingPipeline

    pipeline = TrainingPipeline(config)
    pipeline.run()

Distributed Training
--------------------
The pipeline supports distributed training via PyTorch's `DistributedDataParallel`:

.. code-block:: yaml

    training:
      distributed: true
      num_gpus: 4

Custom Pipelines
----------------
You can define custom pipelines by extending the base `Pipeline` class:

.. code-block:: python

    from OpenSLR.Pipeline import BasePipeline

    class CustomPipeline(BasePipeline):
        def run(self):
            # Custom logic here
            pass
