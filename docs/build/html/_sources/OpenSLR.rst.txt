OpenSLR
=======

Overview
--------
OpenSLR is a unified, modular, and open-source deep learning toolbox for Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR). It is designed to re-implement various CSLR methods within a unified architecture, enabling researchers to easily implement, compare, and experiment with different components.

Key Features
------------
- **Modular Design**: Easily swap spatio-temporal feature extractors, sequence models, and alignment strategies.
- **Unified Architecture**: All methods are re-implemented under a standard structure for fair comparison.
- **Multi-Dataset Support**: Includes support for Phoenix14, CSL-Daily, and other benchmarks.
- **Reproducibility**: Ensures reproducible research with consistent evaluation protocols.

   **Figure 1: OpenSLR System Architecture**
   
   The diagram illustrates the comprehensive layered architecture of the OpenSLR toolbox:
   
   **Top Layer** (User Interface):
   - **Website Interface**: Web-based user interface
   - **API Service**: Programmatic access to toolbox functionality
   
   **Core Components** (Toolbox Modules):
   1. **Dataset**: Handles RGB and Keypoint data inputs
   2. **Manager**: Contains Base Manager, Argument Manager, Config Manager, Log Manager, Device Manager, 
      Module Manager, Experiment Manager, Collect Manager, Dataset Manager, and Dataloader Manager
   3. **Pipeline**: Manages Training, Test, Inference, and Extraction workflows
   4. **Build Function**: Factory pattern for constructing models
   5. **Sign Recognition Model**: Comprises Spatio Container, Temporal Container, Alignment Container, and Decoder
   
   **Bottom Layer**:
   - **Database & Operating System**: Foundation infrastructure
   
   The architecture follows a clear separation of concerns with well-defined interfaces between components.

Component Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Dataset Component**
   This component serves as the unified data loading mechanism, designed to generate multi-stream 
   data outputs. It processes diverse video inputs, from RGB frames to skeletal keypoints.

2. **Manager Component**
   This centralized component coordinates all toolbox operations. It is structurally divided into 
   two categories: base managers and deep learning related managers.

3. **Pipeline Component**
   This component defines the end-to-end execution workflow for training, testing, inference, 
   and extraction.

4. **Build Function**
   This component dynamically assembles the Sign Recognition Model by combining required modules.

5. **Sign Recognition Model**
   This model serves as the core algorithmic component, designed with a modular architecture.

For detailed information on each component, refer to the respective documentation pages.
